Authorize.net - PHP API Class

Introduction
============================

Not quite satisfied with existing classes (that I could find) I wrote this
class for a recent project. Written using PHP5, this provides a very clean way
for your projects to interact with the Authorize.net AIM API.

The latest version also includes a new class for working with the Authorize.net
Automated Recurring Billing (ARB) API.


Basics
============================

First, simply create an instance after including the class file in your code.

$pay = new Authorizenet($trxn); // see below for what $trxn is

To enable debug mode (which sends to the test url, etc), simple set debug to
true:

$pay->debug = true;



Single Payment Transaction
============================

You need to provide an array of transaction values to the class. You must
provide your Authorize.net login and transaction key (and password if needed)
as well as the transaction details - customer, amounts, etc.

$trxn = array(
	'x_login'		=> 'LOGIN',
	'x_tran_key'	=> 'TRANSACTION_KEY',
	'x_first_name'	=> '',
	'x_last_name'	=> '',
	'x_email'		=> '',
	'x_card_num'	=> '',
	'x_amount'		=> '',
	'x_description'	=> ''',
	'x_exp_date'	=> '',
	'x_card_code'	=> ''
);

$pay = new Authorizenet($trxn);
$pay->process(); // Actually process the transaction against API

// Check if this was approved, or not
if($pay->isApproved()){
	// stuff
} else {
	// stuff
}


You may return the full response array in different ways:

// "code" named:
$pay->getCodeNamedResponseArray();

This returns the array with key names that are valid variable names - all lower
case, no spaces, etc. These can be used easily with the included SQL file.

// "nice" names:
$pay->getNiceNamedResponseArray();

This returns the array with human-readable key names.

// raw:
$pay->getResponseArray();

This returns the array that was provided back from Authorize.net, no key changes.



Recurring Billing - Creating
============================

The second class is for working with the recurring billing API. This first example
covers how to create a new subscription.

$trxn = array(
	'x_login'				=> 'LOGIN',
	'x_tran_key'			=> 'TRANSACTION_KEY',
	'x_ref_id'				=> '', // your reference number for account
	'x_subsc_name'			=> '', // Provide a name for this subscription
	'x_length'				=> '1', // Length of units
	'x_unit'				=> 'months', // days, months
	'x_start_date'			=> '', // start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
	'x_total_occurrences'	=> 9999, // eternal length of subscription
	'x_trial_occurrences'	=> 0, // billing occurrences during trial
	'x_trial_amount'		=> 0,
	'x_first_name'			=> '',
	'x_last_name'			=> '',
	'x_card_num'			=> '',
	'x_amount'				=> '',
	'x_exp_date'			=> '' // Card expiration, in YYYY-MM format
);

$pay = new Authorizenet_recurring($trxn);
$pay->process();

Just like the single pay methods, you use $pay->isApproved() is check if the
new recurring billing account was accepted.

There are several ways of seeing additional data returned by Authorize.net:

$pay->refId(); // Returns the reference ID you provided
$pay->resultCode();
$pay->responseCode();
$pay->responseMessage();
$pay->subscriptionId(); // Keep this, as it must be provided for any update or cancel
$pay->createOrderHash(); // Internal way of creating unique order hash



Recurring Billing - Updating
============================

$trxn = array(
	'x_login'				=> 'LOGIN',
	'x_tran_key'			=> 'TRANSACTION_KEY',
	'x_ref_id'				=> '', // your reference number for account
	'x_subsc_id'			=> '', // subscription id from ARB creation step
	'x_card_num'			=> '',
	'x_amount'				=> '',
	'x_exp_date'			=> '' // Card expiration, in YYYY-MM format
);

$pay = new Authorizenet_recurring($trxn);
$pay->process();

The class will automatically pass the proper update xml request because of
that sunscription id being provided.



Recurring Billing - Cancel
============================

$trxn = array(
	'x_login'				=> 'LOGIN',
	'x_tran_key'			=> 'TRANSACTION_KEY',
	'x_subsc_id'			=> '', // subscription id from ARB creation step
);

$pay = new Authorizenet_recurring($trxn);
$pay->cancel();
$pay->process();



Using Peregrine
http://github.com/botskonet/Peregrine
============================

Peregrine is a PHP array security class that will be useful when validating
your form data, as well as securely accessing the returned result data.

For example, you can simply pass the results of the above array functions
into the sanitize function of Peregrine, and use the secure methods to access
to the response data.



Testing
============================

Test Card Numbers:
370000000000002	 - AMEX
6011000000000012 - DISCOVER
5424000000000015 - MC
4007000000027	 - VISA
4222222222222	 - INVALID



To-dos
============================

I'd like to expand the functionality of this class with the following items:

- Integrated Peregrine support
- Ability to use constants for Auth.net credentials instead of array element
- Internal validation for incoming data
- Expanded method list for accessing response data
- Support for other Auth.net features like CIM
- Unit testing.
